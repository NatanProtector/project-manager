# Project Management App  

This is a simple app designed to manage and display information for a pretend project, including details such as:  
- **Employees**: Manage the team associated with the project.  
- **Project Details**: Add and edit key project-related information.  
- **Images**: Search for and select relevant images using the Unsplash Image Search API.  

The app was created as a **homework assignment** for a **Distributed Systems class** and serves as an exercise in web development basics, focusing on **CRUD operations** and API integration.
